  text: "Why Splash?
  
  
  If you're like most people, you probably hate spending half an hour on your knees scrubbing your toilet — and then having to do it all over again if you don't get it clean enough the first time."
  textBottom: "Splash's fast-acting, no-scrubbing foaming powder makes cleaning your toilet a breeze. It's everything you could possibly want in a toilet cleaner, and more! The secret to its effectiveness is in its NanoTech formula. It is powerful enough to bond with stains and lift them from surfaces, yet safe for your tank system and also your skin. The result is a clean and fresh toilet that looks brand new with absolutely no scrubbing on your part. Just sit back and watch all the calcium deposits, limestone, and rust spiral down the drain!"

  heading: Why is Splash Better Than the Standard Toilet Cleaners?
  headingLabel: Ease To Get
  subheading: "**Cleaning the Toilet is a Nightmare and You Know it!**


    Who likes getting up and personal with a toilet? No one. The filth that carries diseases, the germs, the smell… It’s no wonder that cleaning the toilet makes 32% of people gag and is almost 100% of people’s least favorite bathroom cleaning task. Sometimes, when cleaning a toilet, toilet water actually ends up touching your skin, and nothing feels grosser than that.
    



    **Don’t Bend Down and Scrub - Use Splash**


    That’s why we invented Splash. With Splash you don’t need to get on your knees, you don’t need to get up and personal with a toilet, you just need to pour and let Splash do the rest! Award winning, Splash is the next generation of toilet cleaners using surfactant scrubbing technology so you don’t have to."

  heading: Multi-Purpose Cleaning
  subheading: "Another great thing about Splash is that it’s actually a wonderful multipurpose cleaner. You can use it on any bathroom surface and on most kitchen surfaces! To use it to clean surfaces other than your toilet, use as a scouring paste. Simply take a scoop of Splash, put it in a bowl, and then dip a damp papertowel or sponge into the powder. Alternatively, you can super-charge your cleaning by adding a bit of white vinegar directly into the powder until it becomes a paste. (Careful, it will foam!) Hint: It works great on"

  title1: '"WOW!"'
  text1: "I was very pleasantly surprised with this product. I was used to the runny liquid cleaner, but decided to try this cleaner this time. WOW! It foamed up and cleaned the toilet bowl clean as a whistle! The magic words are: TRY ME, YOU WILL LIKE ME!"
  name2: "Evon L."
  title2: '“The toilet was sparkling clean as advertised”'
  text2: The process of using the cleaner is very effective. I forgot to flush one of my toilets after the 1hour waiting period and the solution stayed in the toilet overnight. The bubbles were gone but the toilet was sparkling clean as advertised. I look forward to sharing the good news about your product!!!
  name3: Ashleyrose A.
  title3: '“I don’t have to touch that filthy toilet ever again"'
  text3: It changed a filthy toilet into a sparkling white toilet again. I sprinkled in the blue splash foam cleaner. It started to work the second it hit the water. I waited 30 minutes while I did something else. I came back and flushed it. Vola, No scrubbing. I don't have to touch that filthy toilet ever again.
  name4: Betty C.
  title4: '“No Scrubbing Required"'
  text4: I have very hard water and had to scrub dark brown stains from my toilets every couple of days. I was skeptical about Splash cleaner but decided to try it as a last resort. I thought it would take a few uses to get rid of the stains, but they were gone with the first use...and no scrubbing required. I highly recommend Splash to everyone.
