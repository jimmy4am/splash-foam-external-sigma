intro: "If you’re like most people, you hate cleaning toilets.


If you’re me, you DESPISE cleaning toilets with all your heart. So when I got this assignment to test different toilet cleaners out in our office bathroom, I was not pleased to say the least.


But now, maybe I can claim the title of most knowledgeable person in the world of different kinds of toilet cleaner, right? That’s got to count for something. I’ll have to put that on my resume for when I apply to another job that won’t make me write about cleaning toilets.


But I digress. Let’s talk about toilet cleaners, not how awful it is to repeatedly clean toilets even if you’re getting paid for it.


What I learned during my toilet cleaning saga is not all toilet cleaners are created equal. I expected them all to work more or less the same, but that’s just not the case.


As an honest reviewer, I was surprised that the test winner was a smaller company with a highly reliable product that actually provided the most effective (and affordable) toilet cleaner.


    ‍**This year’s Top 5 Picks, along with a full review of our top pick, are as follows:**"
article: "## We Bought & Tested the Most Popular Toilet Cleaners. Here’s Why Splash Is #1

    ![Splash Foam](https://imagedelivery.net/3TTaU3w9z1kOYYtN3czCnw/be2feef4-98f8-45b2-d0d6-f1d05ed1b100/public)

    
   **SUMMARY:** Splash is an easy way to clean toilets. Let’s be clear, other products can work but they typically cost more and require more elbow grease, while Splash safely and effectively cleans without effort. And the best part is each one can last up to 6 months per toilet!


The manufacturer currently is offering 50% off on the first orders if bought from their website HERE.


**UPDATE** – I found out after a friend tried to buy one that these are sold out in all retail stores. You may be able to find updated availability on their website HERE.


‍I’ve spent over 20 years cleaning toilets and never had any toilet cleaners WOW me. Many methods promise to work but often seem no better than water.


And some toilet cleaners smell bad enough to give me a migraine and make my lungs ache.


But hearing the promise of no-scrub and fast cleaning of Splash, I had to give it a try, even if it sounded too good to be true.


See, I always thought the best way to clean something was a lot of good old-fashioned elbow grease (even when that means getting up and personal with a toilet!) I thought this review would prove that.


I was pretty much wrong. But thankfully so, because now I won’t be scrubbing toilets ever again!


    ## First Impression
 

  ![Splash Foaming Toilet Cleaner](https://imagedelivery.net/3TTaU3w9z1kOYYtN3czCnw/5ab06daf-c822-498c-75a6-0222a5103300/public)



When Splash first arrived at my door a few days after purchasing it, I didn’t think much of the box. The container it comes in though is pretty cute, not that that much matters. It just seemed high-quality, like something you would never be able to find at a discount store.


It had a good weight to it, it was bigger than I expected.


On top of everything, I was happy to see it was made in the USA. I always prefer products made in the USA because that means you can trust that regulations mean they are doing things by the book and because that means they’re employing American workers and keeping jobs here at home.



    ## Smell


    When I opened the bag, I was intrigued. I was immediately greeted by a fresh scent that was pleasant without being remotely overpowering. As someone who is sensitive to smells (I can’t even handle candles!) I appreciated that the moment I shut the container, the smell was gone.


I like things to smell fresh but not linger long enough for me to develop a headache…though I’ve got to say, Splash smelled so good I kept opening it up to give it another whiff.


## Texture


Maybe it seems like overkill to describe the texture of a powdered toilet cleaner, but I think it’s worth mentioning because Splash’s texture is unique, unlike the texture of any powdered cleaners I’ve ever seen before.


It’s this pretty sky-blue powder interspersed with cloud-white thin little specks I could only describe as crystals.


I got to admit I was maybe judging a book by its cover, but I was already impressed. Splash claims to be a unique product, and it was good to see it looks like a unique product too!


## Testing


    ![Testing Splash Foam](https://imagedelivery.net/3TTaU3w9z1kOYYtN3czCnw/c092a84f-6ebf-4c6f-0568-b6e92fc83400/public)


    There was nothing left to do but to give it a try.


I initially tested it the way I was testing all the other toilet cleaners: I spread a little peanut butter on the bottom of the office toilet to emulate skid marks. Then I followed the Splash instructions…


I simply poured a scoop into the toilet. Right away, it started foaming. It was incredibly satisfying to watch as the foam spread out over the surface of the water, blue and fluffy.


Next, I let the foam dissipate. I went and made myself a cup of coffee then came back to the toilet to flush it like the instructions said.


And newsflash: the toilet was completely clean! It sparkled like the ocean if the ocean was white and made of porcelain.


Already, Splash had performed better on the ‘peanut butter test’ than any of the other toilet cleaners I tried. But the real test was everyday use.


Would it be able to stand up to real skid marks and stains?


I didn’t have to wait long to find out. Our office toilet gets a lot of use (I guess my coworkers eat plenty of fiber!)


After a week without cleaning it, the toilet was straight-up toxic to use, but I wanted to see how Splash would perform on a real test.


Maybe you guessed it by now, but Splash knocked it out of the park! Within minutes, without me having to do anything other than pour in a scoop, the toilet was clean enough to eat out of.


I had to bring Splash home then and try it for myself. It was a total game-changer. I have a tendency to let my toilet go too long without cleaning it, but with Splash I actually looked forward to cleaning my toilet, so now it’s sparkling clean all the time!


I’m never going back to cleaning my toilet the old-fashioned way again.

    
    ## What Makes Splash Different From Other Products?
    
    
    Splash stands out for many reasons:


‍**Concentrated Powder** – Other companies selling liquid toilet cleaner are actually charging you for the water in their cleaner, and selling non-concentrated cleaner.


‍**No Scrubbing** – Just let the foam do the scrubbing for you.


**‍Multi-Use** – Unlike other products, Splash can be used outside the toilet as a scour powder.


**‍6 Use Supply** – each Splash comes with 6 uses worth of cleaner, which is a 6-month’s supply for one toilet.


**‍Fast & Easy** – Splash’s main selling point is to make cleaning your toilet fast and easy and it succeeds!

    
    ## Verdict
    

    I didn’t think that Splash would be my top recommendation when I started this project, it didn’t make sense that something this affordable could challenge the high-end and retail products.


But as soon as I had it in my toilet, I had to change the scores on all the other products at once as it outperformed everything with ease!


If you are looking for easy results because you hate the time spent cleaning a toilet as much as I do, then Splash is the best solution.


You will have a clean toilet and you won’t have to breathe in disgusting toilet water to do it!


No more scrubbing, and especially, no more stains!
    

    ## A Recent Problem Occurred


I loved this product when I first purchased it. I told a friend about it (she’s got three teenage boys and two toilets.) She went to purchase it, and she found it was hard to find one available.


With the 50% off discount, it’s going to be more difficult to find these available, but you have to do it.


My friend ended up purchasing a copycat product of Splash, assuming it would work.


It was a complete waste of time and her eyes ended up stinging.


So do make sure to order from the company’s official website to get the real deal as well as a hefty discount.


## How To Order Your Splash


1 - Be sure to visit the website – linked here


2 - Get the 50% discount while it remains available


3 - Choose the number of Splash you want (sharing with friends is caring!)


4 - Submit your shipping and payment information


5 - Have the cleanest toilet ever!


## Common Questions & Answers


**Q: Does it really work?**

‍YES. It works. I gave some to my mom as well (she’s getting up in the years) and it erased stains in her toilet that we thought were permanent.


**‍Q: How does it work?**


‍Surfactant chemical technology peels dirt and stains from porcelain. The foam in Splash increases surface tension and surface area of the cleaner so you need less to do more work.


**‍Q: Is this really going to work on my toilet?**


‍While your results may be different, it works on most toilet and stains. But even if it doesn’t work, there’s a money-back guarantee!


## How Much Does It Cost?


I’ve seen other toilet cleaners priced at $50 or more for professional quality. Splash is priced at $40.00. The company is offering a good price because it’s not well known and doesn’t have a lot of money invested in marketing.


The 50% off deal makes this product an even better price point of $19.95!

## How Can It Be So Affordable?


There’s little marketing being done by the company. They’re also not keeping them on any store shelves, which means they don’t have to charge as much. Plus, the company is aiming to make a name for itself.


## Why Is It Discounted Right Now?


The best guess is because the company is working to build up the brand for it, and they want to see what customers think.


By getting it in as many hands as possible they generate a buzz that will create more sales. And it’s obviously working as they’re constantly running out of stock.
